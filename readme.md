# Fastenal Store Finder

This app takes the 5 letter branch code of any Fastenal Store and returns the address in the lower input field once you click "Get Directions" it will take you to Google Maps with the address fields already filled out for you. 

Note: This is designed for moble. I want to get the functionality down before the designing for all platforms.
