# Fastenal Store Finder

This app takes the 5 letter branch code of any Fastenal Store and returns the address in the lower input field once you click "Get Directions" it will take you to Google Maps with the address fields already filled out for you. For testing use "NYWOD" or "ALBI3" or find a store from https://www.fastenal.com/locations/all and choose a "5 Code"

Note: This is designed for moble. I want to get the functionality down before the designing for all platforms. 

It's pretty clear by now that I need to learn more React and remake this in React. 

TODO: 
[ ] Spend more time on design.
[ ] Add "Find by city" functionality
[ ] Add "Find by City and State functionality
[ ] package with PhoneGap???
